  chess_events.1.d:0 "Work in progress...\nCurrently only set the province modifiers as starting. Porbably needs some changing once going deeper into making specific moves for each piece.\nI'm thinking that adm dev button is to select that piece.\nDip dev button no idea, was thinking it would show possible moves for that piece but adm dev button can already do the trick.\nMil dev button cancels? but can also cancel with adm dev button, which is just selecting new piece. So in that case, not fully certain the use for mil dev button as well."
